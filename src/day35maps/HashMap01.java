	 		How a HashMap works internally in Java
	 		
	 		1) If you fill 75% of buckets, Java creates new 16 buckets. This is called "Load Factor"
	 		2) Java creates "HashCode" by using "Key", then converts the hashcode to existing
	 			indexes then put the data into bucket by using the index.
	 		3) Sometimes the indexes that are created from HashCodes can be same, this is called "Hash Collision"
	 		4) Java uses LinkedList in every bucket. If "Hash Collision" occurs, Java can put multiple data into a bucket
	 			by using linked list structure.
